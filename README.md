# Project BudBurst Mobile

[Project BudBurst Mobile](http://networkednaturalist.org/budburstmobile) is a mobile version of the national citizen science campaign to observe plant responses to climate.

* A collaboration between [CENS](http://cens.ucla.edu) and [Project BudBurst](http://budburst.org) has created a framework to use cell phones to upload photos, observations, and comments.

* The BudBurst Mobile client is currently being used to [map the trees on the UCLA campus](http://networkednaturalist.org/uclatreemap/).

* This app will also allow you to participate in our [FloraCaching.org](http://networkednaturalist.org/floracaching/) projects.
